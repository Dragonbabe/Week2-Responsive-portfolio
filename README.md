# Week2-Responsive-portfolio
# **This Is My Responsive portfolio Page**
*What You Are About To See*
1. Some of my first pieces of work creating websites.
2. To demonstrate the difference between my first homework and this one. Even though they are similar they are not the same.

*Why Did I Decide To Do This*

I had not written a README yet and I wanted to learn about Markdown, and also introduce a little bit about this project.

*What Have I Learned Doing This Project*

1. I have learned that writing your own css is excessively difficult and I really did see the gaps in my knowledge when I was trying to submit the first week's homework.
2. I also learned that using Bootstrap is an incredibly great resource that  not only makes everything much easier but also it enables the code you write to be responsive on your webpage! 

*Enjoy!*
