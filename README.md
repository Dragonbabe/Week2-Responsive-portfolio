# The Portfolio of Esther Walker #

# Description #
* This was my second homework assignment initially. It started out with just html and css. And then a little bit later I learned about Bootstrap and I added that into my file. And now I actually added some of my projects and homework assignments to it!

## Mamma Mia
 
 Project one was a web application for users to be able to look for events within a certain city. We used three different API's. We also had three separate files. It was really neat getting to collaborate with others for the first time! We had three JavaScript files and two html files and a css file.
 We designed the first page the user gets to to be where they input information on where they would like to see an event, the date and the name of the artist.
 After user types in a data then the events display below
 The more information link reroutes to another page with more details on the specific event the user was interested in.
The final page is the favorites page for users to save the information that they would like to look at later!

# Homework 5 - DayPlanner #
This homework had me using JavaScript to create a website where users could save appointments of every hour of the work day and the user input box would change based on weather the hour of the day was past present or future.

# Homework 6- Weather Dashboard #
This homework I had the opportunity to use API's for the first time! I had to use three different one. One for the current weather, one for the UV Index specifically, and the last one for the weather forecast.

# Conclusion #

This assignment was great. It was a really neat check-in point to revisit one of my first assignments and  see how much I have learned in a little over a month of learning programming languages. 

# Shoutouts and Acknowledgements #

Thank you to all my classmates, the TA's and my instructor for being there for me for late night slack coding questions, patience with my learning style, and helping me understand all these concepts! I am loving this journey! :smile:
