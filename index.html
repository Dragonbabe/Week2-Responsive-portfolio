      <p style="font-size:2vw;">
        My name is Esther Walker. Some of my favorite hobbies are horse-back riding, hiking,
        backpacking and climbing. Living in the Pacific Northwest affords many
        opportunities to enjoy the outdoors until my heart is content! I also enjoy
        running Spartan races and I completed my first Trifecta this year, a combination of the Spartan
        Sprint (4+ miles of
        obstacle racing, 20+ obstacles), the Spartan Super (8+ miles, 25+ obstacles), and the Spartan Beast
        (13+
        miles, 30+ obstacles). I have a goals
        to participate in a half marathon at the end of 2020 and then participate
        in an an Ironman in 2021!</p>
      <p style="font-size: 2vw;">I got interested in Software Development because it is an amazing place
        to discover new things and challenge myself. In April of this year I started working at Amazon
        with
        the Dex Robotics
        program. It has been so interesting being a part of the culture of Software Development and the
        amazing things technology is accomplishing! I decided to pursue a career in this field
        ultimately
        because there are
        so many fascinating directions and opportunities to pursue! I have only gotten a taste of it in
        my
        new position at Amazon, and I have gotten to learn even more since I started my education with
        the
        UW Coding Bootcamp! It is very exciting and I am ectstatic to be learning more.</p>
